# Ethics in AI: Potential biases in AI-based financial services

Alberto Danese, Head of Data Science at Nexi Italy and Kaggle Grandmaster, challenged us to identify bias in the data collected by a financial institution on users who have applied for a mortgage. "application_train.csv" of the [Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data) was used as reference dataset.

The predictive variables in the dataset concerned biographical, social, and economic information about the users, while the target variable informs whether or not the user has repaid his or her debt.
