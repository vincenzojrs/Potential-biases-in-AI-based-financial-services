### TO BE DONE BY 5.11.2022 ####

1. The code can run only in a venv with 3.7.10 working python. No conda. Martina should have the right venv.
      If you are in troubles, try to download the venv and open it as project in pycharm or your favourite IDE
1. Change the metrics from MSE to AUC in the function we created
2. Change the variables list to ethical ones in [#5- #6] block
3. The code is already commented. Then, comment the markdown with your thoughts
4. Add the exploratory data analysis at the beginning. If you used a third-party software, try to translate into Plotly.
      If you can't, add screenshots in the markdown blocks in the jupyter
